Hyperfocus is a web based application that will assist students with learning disabilities centering around Executive Function Disorder (EFD). Executive functions include the cognitive and mental capabilities that allow people to be goal-oriented, focused and organized. Executive function is highly connected to Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD or ADHD). People who have this disorder are more motivated by short-term goals and activities. Approaching this issue from the point of view of a student learning and studying takes a lot more effort for people with EFD and ADD. The web application will act as study guide generator that will allow them to quickly input the information and output a fully formatted and organized study guide.
